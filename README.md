# SoundEffectManager

Is just that. It's a simple sound effect manager for playing sounds using the awesome HTML 5 Web Audio API.

If you think I'm talking about `<audio>` tags, go read this: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/

It's significantly better than `<audio>` tags for several reasons:

- You don't have to create a tag for each sound you want to play
- You can multiplex an effect without having to create duplicate tags
- You can also control volume and add other effects

It seems to work with wav and mp3 files.

## Downsides

- Only works in newer chrome and safari

## How to use this

`npm install sound-effect-manager`

Or just grab the single soundeffectmanager.js file and use it.
